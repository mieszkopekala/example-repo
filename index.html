        <h2>R46 Subway Car</h2>
        <p>The R46 is a New York City Subway car model that was built by the Pullman Standard Company from 1975 to 1978 for the IND/BMT B Division. They replaced all remaining R1–9 fleet cars and General Electric-powered R16s, and some R10s. The R46 order initially consisted of 754 single cars, each 75 feet (23 m) long, and was the largest single order of passenger cars in United States railroad history at the point of the fleet's completion. The R46 was the second order of 75-foot cars to be ordered for the New York City Subway, after the R44s.

The first R46s ran in passenger service on July 14, 1975. The fleet was initially slated to be delivered between 1973 and 1975, but a strike at Pullman's factory delayed final deliveries until 1978. Several hundred cracks were found in the R46 trucks during their first few years of service, leading them to be referred to as "the most troubled cars ever purchased". Morrison–Knudsen rebuilt the R46s in 1990–1992. The R211 order is replacing the entire fleet of R46s, and as such are expected to remain in service until the late-2020s.</p>

        <h2>R142 Subway Car</h2>
        <p>The R142 is the first mass-produced model class of the newest generation or new technology (NTT) A Division cars for the New York City Subway. It was built by Bombardier Transportation in La Pocatière, Quebec, Canada and Barre, Vermont, U.S. with final assembly performed at Plattsburgh, New York, from 1999 to 2003.[6] There are 880 cars numbered 6301–7180 and another 150 cars numbered 1101–1250, for a total of 1,030 cars, all arranged as five-car sets. Together with the R142As, they replaced the Redbird trains, including the R26, R28, R29, R33, R33S, and R36.

The R142s and R142As are the first New York City Subway cars to feature recorded announcements. The first R142s were delivered on November 16, 1999, though they initially experienced minor issues that were reported while undergoing testing. Following the completion of non-revenue service testing, the R142s were placed into revenue service on July 10, 2000 as part of its 30-day revenue acceptance test. After successful completion, it entered revenue service on October 20, 2000.[7] The last R142s were delivered by mid-2003. In January 2019, the MTA proposed mid-life upgrades to the R142 fleet.</p>

    <section id="R160">
        <h2>R160</h2>
        <p>The R160 is a class of New Technology Train subway cars built for the New York City Subway's B Division. Entering service between 2006 and 2010, they replaced all R38, R40, and NYCT-operated R44 cars, and most R32 and R42 cars. The R160s are very similar to the earlier R143s and later R179s. The biggest difference between the R160 and R143 is the Flexible Information and Notice Display (FIND) system on the R160s in place of static LED maps on the R143s and all A-Division New Technology fleet. As of 2025, the R160 is the most numerous subway car on the New York City subway system.

In total, 1,662 cars comprise the R160 class, which consists of two models, the 1,002 Alstom-built R160A cars and the 660 Kawasaki-built R160B cars. The R160A cars are organized in two different configurations, with 372 cars arranged in four-car sets and 630 cars arranged in five-car sets. All R160B cars are in five-car sets, but are subdivided by which propulsion system they use; the majority use the Alstom ONIX propulsion system also found on the R160A cars, while cars 8843–9102 use Siemens SITRAC propulsion.

Kawasaki had little to no problems in delivering the R160B cars, which entered service on August 17, 2006. Alstom was behind the delivery schedule early on for the R160As, which first ran on October 17, 2006. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority exercised options for both contracts, and by June 2010, all R160 cars were in service. Numerous experimental features were added to the R160s through the 2010s. 64 R160A cars were fitted with communications-based train control (CBTC) equipment installed for service on the Canarsie Line (L train), while the rest of the remaining fleet has CBTC equipment installed for service on the Queens Boulevard Line (E, F, M, and R trains).</p>

    <section id="R179">
        <h2>R179</h2>
        <p>The R179 is a class of 318 New Technology Train subway cars built by Bombardier Transportation for the New York City Subway's B Division. Entering service between 2017 and 2020, the cars replaced all remaining R32s and R42s.

The R179 order originally contained 208 cars that were each 75 feet (23 m) long. In the 2010–2014 Capital Program, the order was changed to 290 cars that were 60 feet (18 m) long – similar to the car lengths of the R143 and R160 cars – with options for up to 130 more cars. The majority of the R179s were supposed to be in 300-foot-long (91 m) five-car sets because the R179s would be replacing the 75-foot-long R44s, which were arranged in 300-foot-long four-car sets. A minority of the R179s were to be arranged in 240-foot-long (73 m) four-car sets. In 2011, the order was reduced to 300 60-foot-long cars with no additional option orders. Because of the R44s' earlier than planned retirement (except the Staten Island Railway cars) and the R32s and R42s assigned to services utilizing eight-car trains at the time, the setup was reversed, with the majority of the R179s being arranged in four-car sets.

The $599 million contract for the R179s' construction was awarded to Bombardier in 2012. At the time, the first R179 train was set to be delivered in December 2014 and the last train would be delivered in July 2017. Because of manufacturing defects during the construction process, the timeline for delivery was pushed back two years, and the cost of the contract rose to $735 million. The first R179 cars were delivered in September 2016, and the first test train of eight cars was placed in service in November 2017. The test train passed its 30-day in-service test in December 2017, which allowed the remaining R179s to be gradually placed in service. All cars were expected to be delivered by early 2019. However, starting in December 2018, several cars had to be withdrawn from service due to defects, and in January 2019, deliveries were temporarily halted while these defects were being fixed. The fleet was temporarily removed from service in January and June 2020 following separate incidents during these months.

In January 2018, sixteen more cars were added to the order as part of a settlement so that there would be 24 five-car sets instead of the 8 originally projected and 49 four-car sets instead of the original 65. In January 2019, two more cars were added to the order as a part of a settlement for further damages. All cars were delivered by December 2019, and had entered service by March 2020.</p>

    <section id="R211">
        <h2>R211</h2>
        <p>The R211 is a class of New Technology Train (NTT) subway cars built for the New York City Transit Authority. Being built by Kawasaki Railcar Manufacturing for the B Division of the New York City Subway and for the Staten Island Railway (SIR), they will replace aging subway car models: all R44 cars on the SIR, plus all R46 and some R68 subway cars. It contain features such as wider doors, information displays, LED-lit doorways and LED interior lighting. The order is split into three parts: R211A and R211T cars for the subway and R211S cars for the SIR. The R211Ts employ open gangways between cars, allowing passengers to see and walk between multiple cars – a feature not present on the subway's other rolling stock.

Planning for the R211 order started in 2011, with the design process starting in 2012. The request for proposal was solicited in July 2016, with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) awarding a contract to Kawasaki in January 2018. Delivery of the pilot cars began at the end of June 2021. The R211As entered service on March 10, 2023, beginning a 30-day acceptance test on the A. Following a successful revenue service test, it officially entered service with the first production set on June 29, 2023. The open gangway R211T test trains entered service on February 1, 2024, on the C, while the first R211S train entered service on the SIR on October 8, 2024.</p>
